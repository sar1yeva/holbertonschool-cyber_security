### **1. What is Cybersecurity?**

Cybersecurity is the practice of **protecting computers, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage**. It ensures the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of information and involves tools, policies, and practices to prevent cyber threats.

---

### **2. What are the core principles of cybersecurity? (CIA Triad)**

* **Confidentiality:** Ensures data is accessed only by authorized individuals.
* **Integrity:** Ensures data remains accurate and unaltered.
* **Availability:** Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed.

These principles guide security policies and risk management.

### **3. How does encryption contribute to security?**

Encryption **converts data into unreadable code** for unauthorized users, protecting **confidentiality**.

* Types:

  * **Symmetric** (same key for encryption/decryption)

  * **Asymmetric** (public/private keys)

* Used in emails, banking, cloud storage, and secure communications.

### **4. What is risk management in cybersecurity?**

Risk management is the process of **identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks** to reduce potential damage.
Steps: Identify threats → Assess impact → Apply controls → Monitor and review.

---

### **5. What are the different types of cybersecurity threats?**

* **Malware:** Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware
* **Phishing & social engineering**
* **Denial-of-Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks**
* **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks**
* **Zero-day exploits**
* **Password attacks**
* **IoT attacks**
* **Injection attacks:** SQL injection, XSS

---

### **6. What is the difference between a virus and a worm?**

* **Virus:** Requires a host file or user action to spread.
* **Worm:** Self-replicates and spreads automatically without user action.

---

### **7. What is social engineering in the context of security?**

Social engineering **manipulates people to reveal confidential information or perform actions that compromise security**.

* Examples: phishing, pretexting, baiting, tailgating.

---

### **8. What are the key components of an information security program?**

1. Security policies and procedures
2. Risk management
3. Access controls
4. Security awareness training
5. Incident response plan
6. Monitoring and auditing
7. Data protection (encryption, backups)

---

### **9. How do security policies and frameworks contribute to an organization’s security posture?**

* **Policies:** Define rules for safe data use and system access.
* **Frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001):** Provide structured guidance to implement security measures.
* **Benefit:** Standardizes practices, ensures compliance, reduces risk.

---

### **10. What is the purpose of the OWASP Top Ten?**

OWASP Top Ten **lists the most critical web application security risks** to help developers and security teams **identify and mitigate vulnerabilities**, like SQL injection, XSS, and broken access control.

---

### **11. What is the role of access control in cybersecurity?**

Access control ensures **only authorized users can access resources**.

* Types: DAC, MAC, RBAC
* Benefits: Prevents unauthorized access, limits insider threats, enforces least privilege.

---

### **12. How does multi-factor authentication enhance security?**

MFA requires **two or more verification methods**:

1. Something you know (password)
2. Something you have (token)
3. Something you are (biometric)

* **Benefit:** Reduces the risk of compromised accounts even if passwords are stolen.

---

### **13. What are the common methods for securing a network?**

* **Firewalls:** Block unauthorized traffic
* **IDS/IPS:** Detect and prevent intrusions
* **VPNs:** Secure remote connections
* **Segmentation/VLANs:** Limit attack spread
* **Access controls:** Restrict network entry
* **Patch management:** Update software to fix vulnerabilities
* **Encryption:** Protect data in transit
* **Monitoring & logging:** Detect anomalies
* **Endpoint security:** Anti-malware, secure devices
* **Redundancy & failover:** Ensure availability

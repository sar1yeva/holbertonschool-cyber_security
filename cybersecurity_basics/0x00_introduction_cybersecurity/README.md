Learning Objectives
1. What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, devices, and data from cyber threats, attacks, and unauthorized access. It encompasses technologies, processes, and controls to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber incidents. Its goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information.
Examples: Protecting a company’s customer database, securing a government network, or defending personal devices against malware.

2. What are the core principles of cybersecurity? (CIA Triad)
The CIA triad is the foundation of cybersecurity:
Confidentiality – Ensures information is only accessible to authorized users.
Methods: Encryption, access controls, strong passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA).
Integrity – Guarantees information is accurate, trustworthy, and unaltered.
Methods: Checksums, digital signatures, version control, backups.
Availability – Ensures authorized users can access data and systems when needed.
Methods: Redundancy, failover systems, disaster recovery, hardware maintenance.
These principles help organizations design security policies and assess risks effectively.

3. How does encryption contribute to security?
Encryption converts data into a coded format that can only be read by someone with the proper decryption key.
Protects data in transit (e.g., emails, online banking) and at rest (e.g., stored files).
Types of encryption:
Symmetric – Same key for encryption and decryption (faster, e.g., AES).

Asymmetric – Different keys for encryption and decryption (secure, e.g., RSA).

Benefits: Prevents unauthorized access, ensures confidentiality, and supports secure communication.

4. What is risk management in cybersecurity?
Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks to reduce potential damage.
Steps include:
Identify assets and threats – Recognize critical data and potential risks (malware, social engineering).
Assess risks – Determine likelihood and impact of each threat.
Mitigate risks – Apply controls (firewalls, access policies, encryption).
Monitor and review – Continuously check effectiveness of controls.
Goal: Minimize security incidents and protect organizational resources effectively.

5. What are the different types of cybersecurity threats?
Common threats include:
Malware – Malicious software like viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware.
Phishing & social engineering – Tricks users into giving sensitive info.
Denial-of-Service (DoS/DDoS) – Overwhelms systems to make them unavailable.
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) – Intercepts communication between parties.
Zero-day exploits – Attacks targeting unpatched software vulnerabilities.
Password attacks – Brute force, guessing, or credential theft.
IoT attacks – Exploit vulnerabilities in connected devices.
Injection attacks – SQL injection or XSS to manipulate databases or websites.

6. What is the difference between a virus and a worm?
Virus: Malware that requires a host file or user action to spread (e.g., opening an infected file).
Worm: Malware that self-replicates and spreads automatically across networks without user intervention.
Key difference: Worms are autonomous, viruses depend on user action.


7. What is social engineering in the context of security?
Social engineering is the manipulation of people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.
Techniques include: phishing, pretexting, baiting, tailgating.
Goal: Bypass technical defenses by exploiting human trust.
Example: An attacker calls an employee pretending to be IT support to get their password.

8. What are the key components of an information security program?
A robust information security program includes:
Policies & procedures – Define rules for data handling and security practices.
Risk management – Identify, assess, and mitigate threats.
Access controls – Manage who can access systems and data.
Security awareness training – Educate employees on cybersecurity practices.
Incident response – Detect, respond, and recover from security events.
Monitoring & auditing – Continuous tracking of systems and compliance.
Data protection measures – Encryption, backups, and secure storage.

9. How do security policies and frameworks contribute to an organization’s security posture?
Security policies define rules and expectations for safe use of information systems.
Frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001, CIS Controls) provide structured guidance to implement security measures consistently.
Benefits:
Standardizes security practices.
Helps comply with regulations.
Reduces risk by defining clear roles and procedures.

10. What is the purpose of the OWASP Top Ten?
The OWASP Top Ten is a list of the most critical web application security risks.
Purpose: Educate developers, testers, and security professionals on common vulnerabilities.
Examples of risks: SQL injection, XSS, insecure deserialization, broken access control.
Helps organizations prioritize security fixes and implement secure coding practices.

11. What is the role of access control in cybersecurity?
Access control ensures that only authorized users can access resources.
Types:
Discretionary Access Control (DAC) – Owner decides who accesses resources.
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) – Central authority enforces access policies.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Access based on user roles and responsibilities.
Benefits: Prevents unauthorized data access, reduces insider threats, and enforces least privilege.

12. How does multi-factor authentication enhance security?
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) requires users to verify their identity using two or more factors:
Something you know (password).
Something you have (security token, phone).
Something you are (biometric, fingerprint).
Benefits:
Reduces risk of stolen credentials.
Protects sensitive systems even if passwords are compromised.
Strengthens security for online accounts, banking, and enterprise systems.

13. What are the common methods for securing a network?
Network security protects the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of network resources. Common methods:
Firewalls – Block unauthorized traffic entering or leaving the network.
Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) – Detect and prevent malicious activity.
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) – Secure remote connections with encryption.
Segmentation & VLANs – Divide networks into isolated zones to reduce attack spread.
Access controls – Ensure only authorized devices and users can connect.
Patch management – Regularly update software to fix vulnerabilities.
Encryption – Protect data in transit over the network.
Monitoring & logging – Track network activity to detect anomalies.
Anti-malware & endpoint security – Prevent infections from reaching network systems.
Network policies – Define acceptable use, remote access, and incident response procedures.
